#What is a GUID and why should we care?

GUID is short for Globally Unique Identifier. If every item in the digital world can be said to have a name, it would be a GUID. It's like a number in our old analog friend the Dewey Decimal System, but on steroids. 

In the Public Media Platform a GUID is a long string of characters like this: 

bb17b68e-0ee6-4090-8536-815e3c77dd08

Any system that has close to 500,000 media items needs a system of GUIDs, and for the PMP this is it.
