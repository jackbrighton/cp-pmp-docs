#What is a GUID and how to use it

GUID is short for Globally Unique Identifier. It's like a number of the Dewey Decimal System, but for digital items instead of books.

In the Public Media Platform a GUID is a long string of characters like this: 

bb17b68e-0ee6-4090-8536-815e3c77dd08

Any system that has close to 500,000 media items needs a system of GUIDs, and for the PMP this is it. Each story, image, audio, and video in the PMP has a GUID.

##Awesome ways to find PMP GUIDs

You can search for stories (and images, audio, video, etc) in the PMP at https://support.pmp.io/

Click on Advanced Search to narrow your search by Type, Source, Tag, Dates, etc, or simply use this url which does the same thing: https://support.pmp.io/?advanced=1&profile=story&has=image

Once you find a PMP item you want to use, you can easily select and copy its GUID:

## Options for fine-tuning your search

Narrowing a search in the PMP browser is the same as in Core Publisher.

* To search just titles, you can enter title:election. 
* If you want a really specific search, you can enter something like title:”election results” which will find only stories with that exact phrase in the title. (Important: if your search term is more than a single word, enclose it in quotes.)
* To search for stories containing a subject in the body of the story, just enter the subject as a Search term without “title:” in front of the term. 
* In the Tag(s) box you can enter one tag or more separated by a space. This will find all stories so tagged. Tags are more specific than a Text search, so are likely to return fewer stories. 
* You can combine Text search and Tags to filter stories even further. 
* Note also that different producers use Tags in different ways, so a search for stories by Tags may produce inconsistent or incomplete results. 

Your search may turn up no stories or too many stories. You can adjust your search and hit the Search button again as needed. 

##Ways to super-fine-tune a PMP search

In the Search Term box you can use these prefixes to further narrow the search:

* title:”search term”
* teaser:”search term”
* tags:”search term”
* content:”search term” (seems to return fewer results that just ”search term”)
* byline:”name”

##Using the GUID

Once you find PMP content you want to use, you can easily [add it to your Core Publisher site](/pulling-pmp-content-into-cp-by-story.md).
