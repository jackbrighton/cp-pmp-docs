#Bugs and Known Issues

##Images

Pulling a story into Core Publisher from the PMP sometimes results in a broken image within the story, making the story unusable or at least impaired. Use your judgement about what works for your purpose.

Related stories added to a post may also display broken images.

These are known issues and should get fixed.

##Category Page urls

When you create a new Category, Core Publisher generates a category page for displaying posts in that category. Sometimes the url uses "category" in the path, and sometimes is uses "term". These are both Category pages:

http://mydomain.drupal.publicbroadcasting.net/category/arts

http://mydomain.drupal.publicbroadcasting.net/term/music

If you're adding a Category page to the Flexi Menu, or  linking to it anywhere else, make sure to grab the correect url: in Manage Categories, right-click on it in the name of the Category and copy the link address. Then you can paste it wherever.

##No results

Sometimes a search for PMP content returns no stories, even though stories exist matching the query.

##Getting help with the Public Media Platform

Anyone having technical problems using the PMP is encouraged to use the [PMP Issues Tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/publicmediaplatform/pmp-issues/issues?q=is%3Aopen).

The [PMP User Guide](https://support.pmp.io/guides) is very comprehensive but somewhat technical. If you are a developer you will love the [PMP API Docs](https://support.pmp.io/docs).

##Getting help with Core Publisher

For any issues with Core Publisher, you should probably start with the [NPR Digital Services Help Center](http://digitalservices.npr.org/support). There you can explore the Knowledge Base, view training videos, find and share solutions with other CP users, and file a ticket with the NPR DS Help Desk.
