#A brief guide to pulling PMP stories and integrating them into Core Publisher websites

At this writing the [Public Media Platform](http://publicmediaplatform.org/) provides access to 428,112 pieces of content from PBS, NPR, APM, PRI, and PRX. As more public media stations begin pushing local content into the PMP, the total store will rapidly grow. Anyone with a PMP account can pull this content and reuse it in various ways. 

For local station websites, access to the PMP means they can pull in content related to their own programs, stories, and projects. Adding related content from the PMP can provide context and depth to local content. Multi-station projects, like the Regional Journalism Collaborations, can use the PMP to aggregate and reuse content from all the stations. This can increase the reach and impact of our work, and grow our audience. 

For stations using Core Publisher, pulling content from the PMP is easy. There are several ways to do this, and this guide explains each method. 

Coming soon, Core Publisher will also be able to push content into the PMP. This will open new doors to collaboration and add tremendous value to the PMP as a platform for sharing content.
