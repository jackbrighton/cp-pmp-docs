#Pulling PMP Content into Core Publisher by Individual Story

There are several ways to pull PMP content into your Core Publisher site. You can set up an [automatic, hourly pull of stories by program, category, or tag for display on Program or Category pages](/hourly-pull-to-a-page.md). The advantage here is you can set it up once, and watch as PMP content automatically flows into your site. But you can't choose individual stories, the stories always go to a specific page, and it may take some time for the stories to begin displaying.

The fastest way to get PMP content is to find individual stories, and pull them instantly into your site. This has the advantage of allowing you to curate specific stories and put them wherever you want on your site. There are two distinct ways to do select and pull individual PMP stories. We'll cover those first, then we'll show [how to organize the display of stories on pages by topic, byline, etc](create-landing-pages.md).

##If you know the [GUID](what-is-a-pmp-guid.md) of a specific PMP story you want:

1. Click on Find Content in the top navigation. 
2. Click the “Pull PMP Doc” tab. 
3. Paste the PMP story GUID into the Search term box.
4. Click the Get document button. 

You'll see a green box with a link to the story. Click the story link and it opens as a web page. You can now edit the story to assign it to a Category, add Tags, or relate it to a Program. This is the most direct way you can organize specific PMP stories on your Core Publisher pages by Category, Tag, or Program.

##If you don't know the [GUID](what-is-a-pmp-guid.md) of a specific PMP story, search the PMP

You can search the PMP for stories from inside Core Publisher:

1. Click on Find Content in the top navigation. 
2. Click on Search PMP docs.
3. In the Text search box, enter a search term. 
4. In the Filter By section, for the Profile select Story. There isn’t much point in searching for just an image, audio, or video if you want to pull in a complete story.
5. In the Creator and Program dropdown menus, make a selection to narrow the search, or leave the default All to search everything in the PMP.
6. Hit the Search button and see the results appear below.
7. Click on a story link to Preview it as a PMP Document. You can Cancel if you don't want it, or hit the Pull button to add the story as a Core Publisher story page.
8. You'll see a green box with a link to the story page. Click the link to open the page, then the Edit tab. You'll want to add a Category, Tag, and/or Related Program, which add the story to the category, tag, or program page. 
9. Hit Publish and you're done.

### Options for fine-tuning your search

* To search just titles, you can enter title:election. 
* If you want a really specific search, you can enter something like title:”election results” which will find only stories with that exact phrase in the title. (Important: if your search term is more than a single word, enclose it in quotes.)
* To search for stories containing a subject in the body of the story, just enter the subject as a Search term without “title:” in front of the term. 
* In the Tag(s) box you can enter one tag or more separated by a space. This will find all stories so tagged. Tags are more specific than a Text search, so are likely to return fewer stories. 
* You can combine Text search and Tags to filter stories even further. 
* Note also that different producers use Tags in different ways, so a search for stories by Tags may produce inconsistent or incomplete results. 

Your search may turn up no stories or too many stories. You can adjust your search and hit the Search button again as needed. 

###Ways to super-fine-tune a PMP search

In the Search Term box you can use these prefixes to further narrow the search:

* title:”search term”
* teaser:”search term”
* tags:”search term”
* content:”search term” (seems to return fewer results that just ”search term”)
* byline:”name”

##Optional: You can also search for content and get GUIDs from the PMP site

You can search for PMP content, and find the GUID for each item you find, on the PMP support site: 

https://support.pmp.io/

Click on Advanced Search to narrow your search, or simply use this url which does the same thing:

https://support.pmp.io/?advanced=1&profile=story&has=image
